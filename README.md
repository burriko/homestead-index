# Homestead Index
Provides a simple index page listing the sites configured within Laravel Homestead.

Clone this repo, and add it to your list of sites in Homestead. Now instead of having to remember which dev sites you have running in Homestead, and what their addresses are, just visit the site you set up as an index.
